# How to check your code

When working on exercises independently, it's common to accidentally race ahead without having understood things clearly.

Make sure you use this checklist before moving onto new topics.

## Syntax

Compare your code closely to examples, for example:

- indentation
- spaces and new lines (also be careful to avoid double spaces)
- upper and lower case
- types of quotes `` '' ""
- use of () [] {}

## Structure

Check the structure of your code against examples that you've seen.

Do you have questions about why the example is structured a certain way?

Do you have ideas for doing things differently?

Discuss with a buddy and then with your teacher.

## Accurate predictions

Make a prediction of what would happen if you changed your code slightly. I'd strongly recommend writing this down.

**Bad exmaple:** "What would happen if I moved this line before that other one?"

**Good example:** "I predict that if I moved this line before that other one, I would see the number `30` in my console."

Then make this change and see if you get the result you expected.

Keep experimenting until your predictions are consistently accurate.

## Conceptual understanding

Could you explain the concept you just learned at a job interview?

Try writing an explanation in your own words, and research any details that you aren't sure of.

When you're done, show it to a buddy for feedback (or tell them out loud).

Bonus points for writing in English, but at the very least you should do this in your preferred language. Even if no-one else in the class speaks this language, just going through the process of writing it out for yourself will be hugely valuable to your understanding.

### Keep notes for posterity

When you start job interviews, you'll thank yourself for keeping an organised list of things to study.

It's very common to forget things after a few months, and you'll need to review what you learned when you have an interview coming up.

I'd recommend starting a private repo with notes to yourself, as a refresher on how to talk through key topics.

## Git workflow checklist

Have you been following this workflow?

- Create a new feature branch for every new exercise
- Commit each part of the exercise as you complete it
- Commit any comments with questions that come up
- Commit comments with answers to those questions as you find them
- Merge your feature branch into master

Does your commit history read like a useful description of the changes you made to your code?

Is all your work backed up on GitHub?

## Documentation checklist

- Document your functions in the style of [JS Docs](https://devhints.io/jsdoc)
(copy / paste from the website, then adapt it)
