# How to present (full or partial) soutions to exercises

## Start with your goal

- How would you explain it to an interviewer who didn't see the exercise?
- What was the point of the exercise?

## Communicate your thought process

- How did you plan the code, before you started?
- Which constraints were there?
- Which approaches did you consider?

## Show us the code

- Give us some context (Where are we in the file system? Which dirs and files are part of your solution? How are your repos set up?)
- Give us a big-picture outline (What high-level steps does the code take?)
- Walk us through the details
