# How to write exercises for real people (who are not you)

## Beginning

- Put yourself in the shoes of the reader
- Set a starting point. Where should the reader begin? (e.g. in which directory? should they already have something set up?)
- Set any conventions to be followed
- Set expectations (how long should this take?)
- Set the goal

## Middle

- Give simple clear instructions
- Use a clear and consistent structure
- Use concise (short and precise) language. Keep a balance of technical and human-friendly language.

## End

- Communicate what you expect the end to look like
- What to do if the result is not as intended
- Reward (even if it's just an emoji ðŸŽ‰)
